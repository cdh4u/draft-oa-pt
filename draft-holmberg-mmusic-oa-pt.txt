Abstract

   This document updates RFC 3264 by clarifying the scope of a mapping
   from a particular dynamic payload type number to a codec (or codec
   configuration) is for a given RTP media flow direction within a
   session.

1.  Introduction

   This document updates RFC 3264 [RFC3264] by clarifying the scope of a
   mapping from a particular dynamic payload type number to a codec (or
   codec configuration) is for a given RTP media flow direction within a
   session.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Update to RFC 3264

   This section updates the first paragraph of section 8.3.2 of RFC

Update to section 8.3.2
-----------------------

OLD TEXT:

   The list of media formats used in the session MAY be changed.  To do
   this, the offerer creates a new media description, with the list of
   media formats in the "m=" line different from the corresponding media
   stream in the previous SDP.  This list MAY include new formats, and
   MAY remove formats present from the previous SDP.  However, in the
   case of RTP, the mapping from a particular dynamic payload type
   number to a particular codec within that media stream MUST NOT change
   for the duration of a session.  For example, if A generates an offer
   with G.711 assigned to dynamic payload type number 46, payload type
   number 46 MUST refer to G.711 from that point forward in any offers
   or answers for that media stream within the session.  However, it is
   acceptable for multiple payload type numbers to be mapped to the same
   codec, so that an updated offer could also use payload type number 72
   for G.711.


NEW TEXT:

   The list of media formats used in the session MAY be changed.  To do
   this, the offerer creates a new media description, with the list of
   media formats in the "m=" line different from the corresponding media
   stream in the previous SDP.  This list MAY include new formats, and
   MAY remove formats present from the previous SDP. The scope of a mapping
   from a particular dynamic payload type number to a codec (or codec
   configuration) is for a given RTP media flow direction within a session.
   The same dynamic payload type number can be mapped to another codec in
   another RTP media flow direction within the same session. The mapping
   MUST NOT change to a different coded (or coded configuration) for the
   duration of a session. Eventhough not recommended, for a given direction,
   multiple dynamic payload type numbers can be mapped to the same codec
   (or codec configuration). Note that a mapping has been created once an
   endpoint has sent and offer or answer, describing the mapping for a
   given direction. Even if the offer or answer is rejected or discarded,
   or if RTP media associated with the mapping is never sent, the mapping
   MUST NOT change for the given direction within the session.

   Within an offer or answer, the mapping is for the RTP media flow direction
   towards the offerer/answerer, unless the media flow is indicated as 'sendonly'
   in which case the mapping is for the media flow direction from the
   offerer/answerer.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations associated with the SDP offer/answer
   mechanism are described in RFC 3264.  As this document only clarifies
   the existing procedures, it does not impact the security
   considerations.
